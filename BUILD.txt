Building on Windows with the official libopenmpt binaries requires compiling in release mode (`scons platform=windows target=release`). Otherwise it will appear to link but crash horribly.


On Linux, if you link libopenmpt statically, it must be compiled with -fPIC, e.g.:

    ./configure --disable-openmpt123 --disable-examples CXXFLAGS="-g -O2 -fPIC"

...but this probably isn't enough, since libs such as zlib will likely be linked dynamically.
